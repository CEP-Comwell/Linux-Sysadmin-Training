## Module 2: Filesystem Hierarchy & Permissions
 
**Overview**
 
Breaks down the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and Linux permission bits to secure and organize your server.
 
**Key Points**
 
- Understand the purpose of key directories (`/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`, etc.)  
- Master the 9-bit permission model: owner, group, others  
- Leverage special modes: SUID, SGID, and the sticky bit for advanced control
 
**Learning Objectives**
 
1. Map files and directories to their roles in the FHS  
2. Harden file and directory access using `chmod`, `chown`, and `setfacl`  
3. Audit and remediate permission issues with `find`, `stat`, and `getfacl`

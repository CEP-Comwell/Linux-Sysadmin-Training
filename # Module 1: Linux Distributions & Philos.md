## Introduction 📖

This module explores why Linux exists, how its culture shapes development, and provides the foundation for choosing the right distribution for your organization. Students will understand the philosophical differences between distributions, their technical architectures, and how these choices impact long-term infrastructure decisions.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Identify Distribution Families**: Distinguish between major Linux distribution families and their characteristics
2. **Evaluate Release Models**: Compare LTS, rolling release, and point release models for different use cases
3. **Assess Package Management**: Understand APT, YUM/DNF, Zypper, and Pacman ecosystems
4. **Navigate Licensing**: Interpret open-source licenses and their business implications
5. **Make Strategic Decisions**: Select appropriate distributions based on organizational requirements
6. **Plan Migration Paths**: Design transition strategies between different Linux distributions

### Practical Example 2: Distribution Families and Package Management

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
lsb_release -a
which apt yum dnf zypper pacman apk
apt --version
